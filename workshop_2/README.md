# Practical task 2. Working with simple shapes and their properties in Figma. Part 1

## Work process:

First, I created five identical squares, each 90×90 pixels, and placed them one below the other. I used squares because they are easier to transform into the desired shapes. In specific places, I rounded certain corners as shown in the reference image.

After that, I grouped all the squares, placed them inside a frame for convenience, recolored them according to the image, and made the frame’s background transparent. Finally, I exported the result as a JPEG file to ensure higher image quality.

2) **Key properties: “appearance” and “layout”:**

3) **The main group and elements in this group:**

## Conclusions:


During my work, I learned how to create and edit basic elements in Figma, apply properties to them (round corners, change colors), group them, and place them in a frame. I also gained practical experience in exporting the finished result in the required format.
