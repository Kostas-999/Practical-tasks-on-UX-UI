# Practical task 5. Bézier curves and vector objects in Figma. Creating vector icons

## Work process

The goal of this assignment was to **learn how to use the Pen Tool and vector networks in Figma** to create custom vector icons using **Bézier curves**.  
The exercise required creating **five icons** in a **border (outline) style**, each placed in its own **24×24 frame**.

Following the task description, I practiced with the **Pen Tool** to understand how control points, handles, and curves interact in vector drawing.  
To improve precision, I also used the online tool [The Bézier Game](https://bezier.method.ac/?authuser=0) to strengthen my understanding of curve control before designing directly in Figma.

Each icon was manually recreated using vector paths and kept consistent in stroke width, corner rounding, and alignment.  
I selected five icons inspired by the provided examples and arranged them on a dark background to highlight their outline contrast.

In the process, I also organized the icons into named layers for better file structure and clarity.

## Conclusions

Through this task, I learned how to create **vector-based icons** using **Bézier curves** and **vector networks** in Figma.  
Working with the **Pen Tool** helped me better understand the geometry of paths, anchor points, and smooth transitions.  
Maintaining consistent proportions and alignment within 24×24 frames improved my accuracy in icon design and deepened my understanding of the vector workflow for scalable UI assets.
