# Practical task 3. Working with simple shapes and their properties in Figma. Creating a geometric pattern. Part 2

## Work process

For this task, I focused on designing a **geometric pattern** using **basic shapes** such as squares, circles, and triangles.  
These elements were chosen to maintain the **geometric structure and visual balance** of the pattern.

I decided to base my composition on the **first pattern** from the provided examples, as it seemed the most interesting in terms of color contrast, composition, and practical application.  
The use of repetition and symmetry helped to create a balanced and modern visual rhythm.

All elements were created in **Figma**, where I adjusted the color palette, alignment, and positioning for each geometric shape.  
After finishing the layout, I grouped the layers for better structure, placed them within a frame, and exported the result for documentation.

## Conclusions

During this task, I practiced creating **complex compositions** using **simple geometric shapes**.  
I learned how to combine basic forms to build a visually consistent and structured pattern, as well as how to apply color, alignment, and layout principles effectively.  
This work helped reinforce my understanding of **geometric design logic** and the importance of structure in UX/UI visualization.
