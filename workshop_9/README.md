# Practical task 9. Automatic placement in Figma. Creating a product (or service) card

## Workflow

The goal of this task was to **create a small product card using the auto-layout feature in Figma**, practicing alignment, spacing, and nesting components.  
The task required using the **auto-layout** feature to dynamically organize content and maintain proportional spacing between elements when resizing.

In accordance with the task, I developed several product cards that represent different approaches to visual structure.
My main tools were: Google fonts (built into Figma), Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (a Gemini model that allows you to create images based on conditions), Auto Layout (for adapting card blocks).  

The only drawback of this work is that the emphasis was placed on the visual part (UI) rather than the practical user part (UX) as a real customer might require.

## Conclusions

This task allowed me to deepen my understanding of **automatic layout** in Figma.  
I learned how to effectively structure product cards, automatically manage spacing, and create reusable interface components.  
By adding Auto Layout, I developed flexible and scalable design elements that can be adapted to different resolutions and product types in the future.  
This workflow is essential for creating responsive, organized interfaces in real-world UI/UX projects.
