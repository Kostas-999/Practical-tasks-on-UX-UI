# Practical task 6. Boolean groups and Flatten in Figma

## Work process

The goal of this assignment was to **explore Boolean operations and the Flatten tool in Figma**.  
According to the *Figma User Guide*, Boolean groups allow you to combine multiple shapes using mathematical operations to create new vector forms.  
These tools are essential for building icons, illustrations, and solid-style elements directly from basic geometry.

In the frame named **“Boolean groups”**, I demonstrated all four Boolean operations with basic shapes (rectangles and circles) and added one vector example for reference.  
Here’s a short description of each Boolean operation:

- **Union:** merges all selected shapes into one solid object. The combined area remains filled.  
- **Subtract:** removes the shape on top from the one below, leaving a cutout effect.  
- **Intersect:** keeps only the overlapping area between the selected shapes.  
- **Exclude:** removes overlapping parts and keeps only non-overlapping areas.  
- **Flatten (Vector):** converts multiple layers or groups into a single vector object for easier editing.

After testing these operations, I created a second frame titled **“Two examples boolean group”**.  
In this frame, I designed **two solid-style compositions** using Boolean operations to demonstrate practical use — combining, cutting, and merging shapes to create complex, unified icons.  
These examples show how Boolean logic can be applied to achieve a cohesive visual style.

## Conclusions

This exercise helped me understand how **Boolean groups** can be used to build complex solid shapes from simple primitives.  
By combining and subtracting elements, I created two distinct icons while maintaining a clean geometric structure.  
Additionally, the **Flatten** tool proved useful for simplifying multiple layers into a single vector path, streamlining editing and export for UI design.
